Your Idea of a Good Presentation
--------------------------------

Find one or two short clips online of presentations you think are good. Spend 5 minutes showing us these clips and telling us why you think they're good or not.

Presentation of an Elevator Talk
--------------------------------

You've stepped into an elevator with a 'big' scientist from near, but not in, your field. Talk for 3 minutes about your research at a very broad level. Your talk should be understandable to any scientist. Make sure to put your work in a context that explains why you're interested in this problem. _Concentrate on focusing on the audience and the 'level' of your pitch_. We'll follow this with a few minutes of questions and a few minutes of discussion on how everyone does.

Presentation of a Short Talk
----------------------------

You've been asked to talk for a few minutes at a departmental seminar. Many students will talk at the same event, so you are given 5 minutes to speak, after which there will be 3 minutes for questions. _Concentrate on preparing slides, and using them appropriately_. We'll follow these 8 minutes with a few minutes of comments on how you did and specific suggestions.

Presentation of Mid-length Talk
-------------------------------

You've been asked to give a short presentation at a conference about your work. It's a plenary session, so everyone from the conference is expected to be there, but they are all more-or-less in your field. You have 7 minutes to speak, followed by 3 minutes for questions. _Concentrate on making the underlying ideas of your research clear to a broad audience_. After these 10 minutes, we'll discuss your presentation. After this we'll discuss some ways of dealing with difficult questions.

The Great Debate, Part 1
------------------------

I will give you a general topic that is somewhat controversial. For example: "We should have a carbon tax." You will pick a side ("we should" or "we shouldn't") and will be given 2 minutes to come up with your arguments. The rest of the class will be on the other side. You will then speak for up to 3 minutes on your side of the argument. _Concentrate on addressing the questions and keeping control of the situation and your own emotions (including laughter)_. After this we will aggressively ask you questions. Your answers to the questions are less important than how you handle the questions and the questioners.

The Great Debate, Part 2
------------------------

As for the previous class, but now we will add the twist of a very rude person in the audience (you will each also be assigned to be rude to someone else); it is your task to shut this person down. _Concentrate on remaining calm and keeping your rude person in check_. Afterwards we will talk about combining everything we've done so far into an AGU-style talk.

American Geophysical Union (AGU) Talks
--------------------------------------

You will prepare and present an AGU talk. You will have 12 minutes to speak, and 3 minutes for questions and changeover. This time, you will prepare and rehearse your own talk, this is a presentation session. To give you all some experience chairing a session, you will each chair the talk preceding yours, this means you will have to make sure that person remains in the time allotted and ask a question if there are none from rest of the audience.
